### Notes

Notes is a [Riddim](http://code.matthewwild.co.uk/riddim) plugin for managing notes inside topics.
Currently, deletion of notes can be triggered via [XEP-0004 Data Forms](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0004.html).
Future updates should also give the user the option to rely on data forms for managing all features of this plugin.
